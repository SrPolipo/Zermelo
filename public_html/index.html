    Introduction:
  </h1>
  <p>
    I'm a 22 year old currently pursuing a masters in <span style = "color:#ee8239">Mathematics</span> at the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. 
    <br>
    This website may contain anything I find interesting.

<p>
I have a small (private) utilitary python library for <span style = "color:#ee8239">Manim</span>, an open source Python library originally created by math educator Grant Sanderson.
Some of its features include:
<ul>
  <li>Pascal triangle-like objects whose squares are also objects which can be controlled both individually or as a whole through a <i>behavior function</i>;</li>
  <li>A generalization of continued fractions which support any approximation through iterated compositions, such as repeated exponentiation or radicals; </li>
  <li>Methods for visualizing periodic functions as functions on a circle, and the method of visualization of Fourier series using circles.</li>
</ul>
Some examples of animations which I've created with this library include:
<br>
<br>
<div align = "center">
<video controls style = "width: 50%; height: 30%"> 
  <source src ="manimations/bohrsets.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></li>
</video>
<br>
By following the construction shown, we can obtain arbitrarily sparse sets of integers with proportionally many solutions to the equation x+y=z in the set.
These are called Bohr sets.
</div>

<div align = "center">
<video controls style = "width: 50%; height: 30%"> 
  <source src ="manimations/sierpisnki.mp4" type = "video/mp4"></li>
</video>
<br>
By painting only the odd integers in Pascal's triangle we obtain a fractal called Sierpisnki's triangle, shown above.
